# Data Science and Machine Learning Notebooks Collection

This collection consists of three Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of data science and machine learning. Below is a brief overview of each notebook:

## 1. Regression Analysis Notebook (`Regression.ipynb`)

### Overview
This notebook dives into regression analysis, focusing on understanding and handling outliers and leverage points and their impact on regression models. It covers:
- Identification of outliers and leverage points in regression.
- The concept of the coefficient of determination (R²) and its importance in regression analysis.
- Implementation of least squares regression in various scenarios, including with and without outliers or leverage points.

### Key Concepts
- Outliers and Leverage Points in Regression
- Coefficient of Determination (R²)
- Least Squares Regression

## 2. MNIST Classification Notebook (`MNIST.ipynb`)

### Overview
This notebook is centered around the MNIST dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning for handwritten digit classification. It includes:
- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST test data.
- Importing necessary libraries from Keras and TensorFlow.
- Steps for reshaping and normalizing test images for model input.

### Key Concepts
- MNIST Dataset Handling
- Image Preprocessing
- Utilization of Keras and TensorFlow

## 3. Central Limit Theorem Demonstration Notebook (`Central_Limit_Theorem.ipynb`)

### Overview
In this notebook, the focus is on demonstrating the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), a fundamental theorem in statistics. The notebook includes:
- Loading of a dataset (FIFA2020 player data) and initial data exploration.
- Handling missing data in specific columns like 'pace' and 'dribbling'.
- Various methods for addressing missing data, such as removal, replacement, and predictive imputation.

### Key Concepts
- Central Limit Theorem
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Data
